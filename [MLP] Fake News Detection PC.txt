  // Step 1: Load Dataset
  LOAD CSV file as 'df'
  SELECT only 2000 rows to reduce size
  FILL any missing text data with empty string

  // Step 2: Preprocessing
  EXTRACT column 'text' as input X
  EXTRACT column 'label' as output y

  // Step 3: Feature Extraction
  INITIALIZE TF-IDF Vectorizer with max_features = 3000
  FIT and TRANSFORM 'X' into vectorized form â†’ X_vec

  // Step 4: Train/Test Split
  SPLIT X_vec and y into training and testing sets (80/20 ratio)

  // Step 5: Model Training
  INITIALIZE MLP Classifier with:
    hidden_layer_sizes = (100,)
    max_iter = 100
    random_state = 1
  TRAIN model using training set

  // Step 6: Evaluation
  PREDICT y_pred from X_test
  CALCULATE accuracy by comparing y_test and y_pred
  PRINT accuracy

  // Step 7: Save Model
  SAVE trained model to 'model.pkl'
  SAVE TF-IDF vectorizer to 'vectorizer.pkl'
